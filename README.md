# JPA-design
Flux driven josephson parametric amplifier design with Metal. It consists of resonator, SQUID, capacitor and a pumpline.

Resonator is short-circuited to ground by dc-SQUID and capacitively coupled to the transmission line.

I analyzed and simulated JPA with HFSS, Q3D. Including rendering and analyzing every process is indeed possible with metal
but due to the license issue with the Ansys Software at my lab, I disconnected the metal with ansys and proceeded the ananlysis, processed the results in ansys.
