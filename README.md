# Josephson Parametric Amplifier(JPA) Design
Flux driven josephson parametric amplifier design with Metal. It consists of resonator, SQUID, capacitor and a pumpline.  
Resonator is short-circuited to ground by dc-SQUID and capacitively coupled to the transmission line.  
I analyzed and simulated JPA with HFSS, Q3D. Including rendering and analyzing every process is indeed possible with metal. Finally, I exported the GDS file from metal and fabricated JPA.
